# Prime Factors Kata

I did this kata as a direct result of reading chapter 6 from `Clean Coder` by `Robert C. Martin`. I received this book in June 2021 from my manager at the end of my internship at `Vector Informatik`. Back then, he told me that being a software engineer is more than just programming, and I didn't understand it at that time. However, receiving this book sparked something in me. It made me realize that there are resources outside of university that teach topics not taught in my lectures - topics I so desperately wanted to learn. It was the beginning of my journey in reading software books.

To this day, I keep coming back to the books I've read. I find myself in a much different state compared to the last time I read the book, and I gain new insights. Lately, my focus is primarily on improving my coding skills and creating a framework to keep my skills sharp and extend my abilities. As the days go by and I solve more and more problems (at work, private projects, katas), I become more aware of what I actually want. As a result, a collection of different training drills is formed in my head that I want to build a framework around.

# About the Kata

I confess that I copied the existing solution as I struggled with this particular task. My tendency to overthink solutions holds me back and with a time pressure (I set up a 30 minute timer), I could not come up with a solution. Generally speaking, I noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is implementing algorithmic-like solutions. This kata was proof of that.

So what am I doing to improve the situation? I ordered `Grokking Algorithms` and hope to improve my understanding and my skills.

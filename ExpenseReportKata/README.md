# Expense Report Kata

After a [coaching session](https://qualitycoding.org/services/coaching/) with `Jon Reid` where primitive obsession was giving me problems, I asked for a kata where I can practice it. The one Jon suggested was the `Expense Report Kata`. This is a legacy code kata where the code first needs to get under test. Only then is it allowed to do refactoring. It is rather small but a great way to practice and learn the concepts.

Even though I knew it was about primitive obsession, I wasn’t sure where the code smell was coming from. After I had a working solution, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVCtMd73doU) to compare my solution, and that’s when I realized there was still some cleaning up to do.

Overall, it went pretty well, and I’ve noticed an increase in my speed.

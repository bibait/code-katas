# Grokking Algorithms

As I mentioned in the `MarsRoverKata`, algorithms seem to be a weakness of mine, and in order to do something about it, I wanted to go through the book `Grokking Algorithms` by `Aditya Y. Bhargava`. It arrived yesterday (22. April 2025), and I aimed to do at least one algorithm a day.

### Binary Search

The first algorithm was binary search. A classic, and yet it felt like there was something in my head blocking me.

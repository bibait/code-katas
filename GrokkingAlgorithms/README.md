# Grokking Algorithms

As I mentioned in the `MarsRoverKata`, algorithms seem to be a weakness of mine, and in order to do something about it, I wanted to go through the book `Grokking Algorithms` by `Aditya Y. Bhargava`. It arrived yesterday (22. April 2025), and I aimed to do at least one algorithm a day. 

**My methodology is as follows**

I read about the algorithm and try to implement it test-driven. Only after I'm done or when I'm totally stuck do I look at the implementation. My solutions all use generics.


### Binary Search

The first algorithm was binary search. A classic, and yet it felt like there was something in my head blocking me. I struggled to do the solution without looking.

### Selection Sort

Up next comes selection sort. This one went much better. I got it working without looking. Yet, after looking at the solution, I found places I can make improvements. In addition, I've added the option to specify whether to sort ascending or descending.
